        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>I am student developer at Nashville Software School, where I have begun studying fullstack web development concentrating on Node.js and other Javascript-based languages.</p>
        <p>My interest in web development was peaked during an early era of social media <span class="jokes">(yes, I am speaking of Myspace).</span> I caught the bug diving through the open HTML &amp; being able to design to my heart's content.</p>
        <p>I have chosen to pursue a career in software development to grow in a career based on the skills and tools to create, to be engaged in a community focused on innovation, &amp; to contribute to society by the working towards better innercommunication for all through the web.</p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Please view the Dev page on this site for a portfolio of my personal work &amp; current/collabrative work at Nashville Software School. You can also visit my GitHub, linked on the Contact Page, to view my development portfolio.</p>
        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>For my time away from glowing squares, my interests will be listed (hopefully in a creative manner) soon in the space given below. For now, here's a pic of my deng catto doing a heckin' lounge.</p>
